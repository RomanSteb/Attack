In February 2022 Russia attacked Ukraine. Different experts in the West did not believe that Ukrainian Army was ready to fight Russian Army Forces and prognosed Ukraine to capitulate in a few days. Unexpectedly for western politicians and so-called experts Ukrainians were prepared to give a tough battle with "the second army in the world" and successfully stopped Russian troops from taking Kyiv - the capital of Ukraine.

But why Russian narratives about its military forces were so successful that even NATO countries got under its influence? And how these narratives correspond with a reality of Russian military-industrial complex?

**What are the narratives on war?**

Nuclear Weapon matters. Having a nuclear rockets, the state can demonstrate its power and ability to make catastropihcal devasttions. The logic of Cold War continues to formulate the security politics.

**What is the reality of war?**

However, Russian military forces appeared to be less powerful than Russian propaganda about it. Thousands of Russians soldiers were killed and military equipment was destroyed during February-June 2022. According to the last updates of Ukrainian General Staff Russia has lost 31 thousand troops, 1 400 tanks, 3400 APV, 675 artillery systems, 210 planes and so on.

Nevertheless, Russia continues this devastating war even under economical sanctions. Despite claiming about new types of Russian T-90, which are transferring to Ministry of Defence from Russian factories, Russia has to reconserve more and more Soviet equipment.

Another evidence that confirm the usage of Soviet military equipment is Russian losses in Ukraine, documented by analysits of [Oryx](https://www.oryxspioenkop.com/2022/02/attack-on-europe-documenting-equipment.html). Analysts mentioned that 4344 military equipment of RAF were damaged, destroyed or captured since 24 February.

In May Russian tank-factory claimed that it sent a set of the newest Tanks - T-90M, however, during the war in Ukraine only one such tank was destroyed that might be an evidence that these tanks are not highly used for battles.

**Russian technologies**

Technologies and modernization cost a lot. However, SIPRI Military Expenditure Database shows that since 1991 Russian did not invest a lot in its Defense sector if we compare these expenditures with expenditures of United State.
